CITATION
===============================================
Anvi'o will use 'PyANI' by Pritchard et al. (DOI: 10.1039/C5AY02550H) to compute
ANI. If you publish your findings, please do not forget to properly credit their
work.

[PyANI] Num threads to use ...................: 12
[PyANI] Alignment method .....................: ANIb

WARNING
===============================================
You are comparing 97 genomes. That's no small task. For context, 10
Prochlorococcus genomes using 4 threads took 2m20s on a 2016 Macbook Pro. And 50
genomes took 49m53s. Consider instead using fastANI (--program fastANI). It's
orders of magnitudes faster.

WARNING
===============================================
The SCG taxonomy database on your computer has a different version (v202.0) than
the SCG taxonomy information stored in your contigs database (v89). This is not
a problem and things will most likely continue to work fine, but we wanted to
let you know. You can get rid of this warning by re-running `anvi-run-scg-
taxonomy` on your database.
