WARNING
===============================================
Some of your genomes (4 of the 12, to be precise) seem to have no functional
annotation. Since this workflow can only use matching functional annotations
across all genomes involved, having even one genome without any functions means
that there will be no matching function across all. Things will continue to
work, but you will have no functions at the end for your gene clusters.

SCGs ARE NOT CALLED
===============================================
Some of the genomes you have for this analysis are missing HMM hits for SCGs (4
of 12 of them, to be precise). This may or may not be critical for your
downstream analyses, but if you would like to be certain or run into a bigger
problem with the later steps of your analysis, you can always run `anvi-run-
hmms` on your contigs databases to call your single-copy core genes. For the
sake of brevity, here is the list of genomes missing SCGs: Nazollae_Afiliculoide
s_reference_0708,Nazollae_Afiliculoides_lab_nanopore,Nazollae_Apinnata_nanopore,
Nazollae_Asp_nanopore.

JUST FYI
===============================================
Some of your genomes had gene calls identified by gene callers other than the
anvi'o default, 'prodigal', and will not be processed. Use the `--debug` flag if
this sounds important and you would like to see more of this message.
