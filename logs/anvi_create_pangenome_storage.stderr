WARNING
===============================================
Good news! Anvi'o found all these functions that are common to all of your
genomes and will use them for downstream analyses and is very proud of you:
'COG14_FUNCTION, COG14_CATEGORY'.

                                                                                   External genomes .............................: 0 found.
JUST FYI
===============================================
Some of your genomes had gene calls identified by gene callers other than the
anvi'o default, 'prodigal', and will not be processed. Use the `--debug` flag if
this sounds important and you would like to see more of this message.
