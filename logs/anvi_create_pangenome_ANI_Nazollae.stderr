WARNING
===============================================
The SCG taxonomy database on your computer has a different version (v202.0) than
the SCG taxonomy information stored in your contigs database (v89). This is not
a problem and things will most likely continue to work fine, but we wanted to
let you know. You can get rid of this warning by re-running `anvi-run-scg-
taxonomy` on your database.
