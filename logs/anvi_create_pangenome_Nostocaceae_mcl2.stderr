===============================================
If you publish results from this workflow, please do not forget to cite DIAMOND
(doi:10.1038/nmeth.3176), unless you use it with --use-ncbi-blast flag, and MCL
(http://micans.org/mcl/ and doi:10.1007/978-1-61779-361-5_15)

WARNING
===============================================
Notice: A diamond database is found in the output directory, and will be used!


WARNING
===============================================
Notice: A DIAMOND search result is found in the output directory: skipping
BLASTP!


WARNING
===============================================
Notice: A DIAMOND tabular output is found in the output directory. Anvi'o will
not generate another one!


MCL INPUT
===============================================
WARNING
===============================================
DIAMOND did not retun search results for 1 of 635493 the amino acid sequences in
your input FASTA file. Anvi'o will do some heuristic magic to complete the
missing data in the search output to recover from this. But since you are a
scientist, here are the amino acid sequence IDs for which DIAMOND failed to
report self search results: hash68b96c00_2597.

MCL
===============================================
MCL inflation ................................: 2.0
Number of MCL clusters .......................: 60,163
CITATION
===============================================
The workflow you are using will likely use 'muscle' by Edgar,
doi:10.1093/nar/gkh340 (http://www.drive5.com/muscle) to align your sequences.
If you publish your findings, please do not forget to properly credit this tool.


WARNING
===============================================
You have 20,108 gene_clusters, which exceeds the number of gene_clusters anvi'o
is comfortable to cluster. But since you have used the flag `--enforce-
hierarchical-clustering`, anvi'o will attempt to create a hierarchical
clustering of your gene_clusters anyway. It may take a bit of time. Pour
yourself a coffee. Or go to a nice vacation. See you in 10 mins, or next year or
never.

FRIENDLY WARNING
===============================================
It seems you have a lot of gene clusters in this pan database :) It is all good!
But please be aware that you may run into performance issues when you try to
interactively visaulize these data using `anvi-display-pan`. In some cases it
may even be impossible to do it, in fact. This is largely because the part of
the anvi'o workflow to offer interactive access to a pangenomes is not designed
to accommodate very large number of gene clusters, but rather enable in-depth
exploratory analyses of pangenomes interactively. You still can work with large
pangenomes via the command line utilities and do a lot of science with them. If
you are unable to work with the interactive interface and it is critical for
you, you have multiple options, You can use the `--min-occurrence` flag to
reduce the number of gene clusters, or use the program `anvi-dereplicate-
genomes` in an attempt to reduce the number of redundant genomes in your
analysis. If you are unsure what would be the best game plan for you, you can
consider coming to the anvi'o Slack channel and consult the opinion of the
anvi'o community. Despite all these, it is still a good idea to run `anvi-
display-pan` and see what it says first.

* Your pangenome is ready with a total of 20,108 gene clusters across 97 genomes ðŸŽ‰
