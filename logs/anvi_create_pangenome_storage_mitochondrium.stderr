WARNING
===============================================
Anvi'o has good news and bad news for you (very balanced, as usual). The good
news is that there are some functional annotation sources that are common to all
of your genomes, and they will be used whenever it will be appropriate. Here
they are: 'KOfam, COG20_FUNCTION, COG20_CATEGORY'. The bad news is you had more
function annotation sources, but they were not common to all genomes. Here they
are so you can say your goodbyes to them (because they will not be used):
'KEGG_Class, COG20_PATHWAY, KEGG_Module'

JUST FYI
===============================================
Some of your genomes had gene calls identified by gene callers other than the
anvi'o default, 'prodigal', and will not be processed. Use the `--debug` flag if
this sounds important and you would like to see more of this message.
