This repository contains code and some results for the pangenomics of _Nostoc azollae_, endo-symbiont of the _Azolla_ genus of ferns.

Here I aim to collect all _N. azollae_ genomes from the _Azolla_ metagenome project, and assemble new ones where possible.
With these genomes, I want to answer questions about the pangenomics, evolution, and co-evolution of this symbiont with its host.
